One of the main factors of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is to exercise often, however exercising often is hard when exercise becomes boring and laborious. While there exists a plethora of fitness applications, most of these applications donâ€™t provide the fervor necessary to make any exercising routine enjoyable and consistent. With that said, Gymmie is an upcoming new web and mobile application designed to motivate people to exercise. The purpose of Gymmie is to build a user-friendly experience for the consumer loaded with incentives, data, and goals to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n###Algorithms and Calculations\r\nAll of our calculations and conclusions are based off user provided information. Using user provided information we are able to employ a leveling system based off of strength standards.\r\nOur algorithm works based on three major point:\r\n\r\n1) User Provided Information:\r\n\r\n>Height, Weight, Gender, Calisthenics Maximum Reps(push-ups,sit-ups,lunges,squats,calf raises)\r\n\r\nBy using this information we can calculate Body Mass Index , Ideal Body Weight, and Rep Maxes which allow us to determine the users current level separated by muscle group and overall.\r\n\r\n2) Calculated Information:\r\n\r\n>Body Mass Index, Ideal Body Weight (Devine and Hamwi's formula), Levels: Overall, Legs, Abs, Upper Arm Lower Arm, Back, Chest, Glutes, Neck\r\n\r\nFormula(s):\r\nBody Mass Index <(weight x 0.45)/ [(height x 0.025)^2]>\r\nIdeal Body Weight Devine's Formula:\r\nMale: <110 + (5.1 x height) - 60>\r\nFemale: <100 + (5.1 x height) - 60>\r\nIdeal Body Weight Hamwi's Formula:\r\nMale: <106 + (6 x height) - 60>\r\nFemale: <100 + (5 x height) -60>\r\nRep Max(Lombardi): <(weight x reps)^0.1>\r\n\r\nWeight is in pounds and Height is in inches\r\nAll levels employ Lombardi's Rep Max  calculation. Body Mass Index and Ideal Body Weight serve as calculations to improve the User Interface by providing more information for the user. [Considering adding the BMI Prime calculation) \r\n\r\n3) Application:\r\n> Our main focus from the prior calculations are relating the calisthenic maximum rep tests with Lombardi's Rep Max formula using body weight percentages to determine how much weight is being lifted by a particular muscle during a exercise. This calcuation which allows us to determine the strength is the most important because it allows us to determine the level of the user after this initial test but also a level scale unique to every person based on their weight.\r\n\r\n###Technologies in Use  \r\n\r\nCurrently Implemented\r\n\r\n> Languages(s): Python 2.7.12, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap.\r\n\r\n> Framework(s): Django 1.9.2.\r\n\r\n> Web Deployment: Python Anywhere (formerly  AWS Elastic Beanstalk using awsebcli and AWS management console.)\r\n\r\nTo be Implemented\r\n> HighCharts\r\n> django-rest-framework, Ionic for mobile apps\r\n>Reconstruction of Web Page\r\n\r\n###Current Web Deployment\r\n[gymmie web application](http://gtb.pythonanywhere.com)\r\n\r\n###Members\r\nGael Blanchard (@gaelblanchard), Billy Wu (@billywu94), Syed Haque (@SyedHaque), Fowad Aslam(@fowad555)\r\n\r\n###Timeline\r\nJune 2016 - present\r\n",
