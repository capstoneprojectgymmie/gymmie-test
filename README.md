##Data Science Involved:

Exercise Recommendation with two levels  


1. Ratings based

2. Strength based

Levels:

> Initial level: based off of initial test results.

>Experience: based on the difficulty of every workout performed potentially degrading to account for exercise routine consistency as well as overtraining

>Level 150: Even with degradation accounting for levels of consistency in a workout routine as well as overtraining a max level must be adequately defined

>Level Scale: Based off the strength standards of human. We relate body weight to certain lifting plateaus such as lifting 1 x bodyweight, 1.5 x bodyweight, 2 x bodyweight etc...
