								<h3>Billy Wu</h3>
								<p>My passion for learning about new technologies began in high school when I enrolled into the Information Technology program. During this time I learned the basics of computer programming languages such as HTML, Python, and Java, which sparked my interest in pursing a degree in Computer Science. My interests away from the classroom includes, reading novels, listening to Sinatra, playing the guitar, and going to the gym. With that said, one of the reasons why Gymmie is being created is because of the fact that our group strives on attempting to help others become healthy in a one of the leading countries in obesity.</p>

								<h3>Fowad Aslam</h3>
								<p>I didn't expect to find myself coding full term apps and websites. The idea of coding got me interested from seeing how a bunch of 0s and 1s could make something greater. Coding is made into almost everything we use and the future will just show the advancement of technology. I want to be there when that happens and being a software developer makes me proud to know how far we got and how far we will get. I am currently working on an app with my team and the app is called GYMMIE. The app will redefine how you work out and perceive the gym. We hope to inspire other small developers to start big things and grow with us as a community.</p>

								<h3>Syed Haque</h3>
								<p>Computer Science is a beautiful field of study, something that I didn't really know much prior to college. What really got me interested what the aspect of just putting bare logic and getting so many different outcomes, things that we can as engineers, and programmers can control. Now, just a few things outside of academia. I like to play soccer, draw, cook, go to the gym, read, meditate, and the list can keep going on an on, but my point is. It's true I like doing a bunch of things because well, life is short, you should do everything you want to do, you don't even need to be good at it. Now applying that to "Gymmie", our app, it's an attempt at getting people to exercise, something that helps to make all aspects of life better.</p>
